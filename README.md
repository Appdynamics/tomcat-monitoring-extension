# AppDynamics Tomcat Monitoring Extension

This extension works only with the standalone machine agent.

##Use Case

Apache Tomcat is an open source software implementation of the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages technologies. This eXtension monitors Tomcat instance and collects useful statistics exposed through MBeans and reports to AppDynamics Controller. JMX has to be enabled in the Tomcat instance for this extension to work. To enable JMX please refer [here] (http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/monitoring.html).
